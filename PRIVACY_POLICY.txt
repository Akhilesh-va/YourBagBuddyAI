Last updated: January 28, 2026

This Privacy Policy explains how YourBagBuddy ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, discloses, and protects information about you when you use our mobile application (the "App") and related services. Please read this policy carefully. By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

This Privacy Policy is intended to be general information and does not constitute legal advice. Privacy laws vary by country and region. You are responsible for ensuring that this policy is appropriate for your specific legal obligations and for seeking advice from a qualified lawyer where needed.

1. Information We Collect

We may collect the following types of information when you use the App:

1.1 Information You Provide to Us
- Account information, such as your name, email address, profile details, and authentication identifiers (for example, when you sign up, log in, or edit your profile).
- Travel and packing information you enter into the App, such as trip destinations, dates, packing lists, preferences, and notes.
- Feedback, support requests, and other communications you send to us.

1.2 Information Collected Automatically
When you use the App, certain information may be collected automatically, including:
- Device information, such as device model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, and mobile network information.
- Log and usage data, such as app interactions, features used, timestamps, and performance data.
- Approximate location information (for example, city or region) if enabled by your device or inferred from network information. The App does not require precise GPS location unless explicitly requested for a feature and permitted by you.

1.3 Information from Third-Party Services
If you choose to sign in using third-party services (such as Google or other identity providers), we may receive certain basic account information from those services (e.g., your name, email address, and profile picture), in accordance with their privacy policies and your settings with them.

2. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect for purposes including:
- To provide, operate, and maintain the App and its features (such as creating and managing trips, checklists, and smart packing suggestions).
- To authenticate you, maintain your session, and secure your account.
- To personalize your experience, such as recommending packing items or checklists based on your inputs and preferences.
- To communicate with you, including sending service-related emails or notifications (for example, account updates, security alerts, or support responses).
- To monitor and analyze usage, performance, and trends to improve the App, fix bugs, and develop new features.
- To protect the rights, property, and safety of our users, us, or others, including detecting and preventing fraud, abuse, or security incidents.
- To comply with legal obligations and respond to lawful requests from authorities, where applicable.

3. Legal Bases for Processing (Where Applicable)

Where required by applicable law (such as in the European Economic Area or United Kingdom), we process your personal data under one or more of the following legal bases:
- Your consent (for example, for optional analytics or marketing communications).
- Performance of a contract (for example, providing the App and its core features to you).
- Compliance with a legal obligation.
- Our legitimate interests (for example, securing the App, preventing abuse, and understanding how the App is used), provided that these interests are not overridden by your rights and interests.

4. How We Share Your Information

We do not sell your personal information.

We may share your information in the following limited circumstances:
- With service providers and processors that help us operate the App (for example, cloud hosting, authentication, analytics, or error logging), who are bound by contractual obligations to protect your information and use it only on our instructions.
- With third-party authentication providers when you choose to log in using their services, in accordance with their terms and privacy policies.
- With third-party AI or recommendation services, only as needed to provide smart packing or similar features based on your inputs. Where possible, we will minimize or pseudonymize the information we send and use it solely for generating results for you.
- With law enforcement, regulators, or other parties when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with a legal obligation, court order, or government request, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of us, our users, or others.
- In connection with a business transfer, such as a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, in which case your information may be transferred as part of the transaction subject to appropriate confidentiality protections.

5. Data Storage, Security, and Retention

5.1 Storage and Security
We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your information against unauthorized access, loss, misuse, or alteration. However, no system can be completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security of your information.

5.2 Data Retention
We retain your information for as long as necessary to provide the App and fulfill the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. When information is no longer needed, we will delete or anonymize it, subject to any legal or technical limitations.

6. Your Rights and Choices

Depending on your location and applicable law, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information, including:
- The right to access and obtain a copy of your personal data.
- The right to correct or update inaccurate or incomplete information.
- The right to delete certain information, subject to legal exceptions.
- The right to object to or restrict certain processing activities.
- The right to withdraw consent at any time where processing is based on consent (for example, disabling optional analytics or marketing communications).

You can exercise many of these rights directly within the App (for example, by updating your profile, editing or deleting trips, or deleting your account if such a feature is provided). You may also contact us using the contact details below to request assistance. We may need to verify your identity before responding to certain requests.

7. Children’s Privacy

The App is not directed to children under the age of 13 (or other minimum age in your jurisdiction), and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children below that age. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child in a way that violates applicable law, we will take reasonable steps to delete such information. If you believe that a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us.

8. International Data Transfers

Your information may be stored and processed in countries other than the country in which you are located. These countries may have data protection laws that are different from those in your jurisdiction. Where required by law, we take steps to ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to protect your information in connection with such transfers.

9. Third-Party Services and Links

The App may contain links to third-party websites, services, or integrations that are not operated by us. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third parties. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third-party services you use.

10. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will revise the "Last updated" date at the top. In some cases, we may provide additional notice (such as in-app notifications). Your continued use of the App after the updated Privacy Policy becomes effective constitutes your acceptance of the changes.
