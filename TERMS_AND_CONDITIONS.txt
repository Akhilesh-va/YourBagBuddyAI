YourBagBuddy Terms and Conditions

Last updated: January 28, 2026

These Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) govern your use of the YourBagBuddy mobile application and related services (the “App”). By accessing or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not use the App.

These Terms are intended to be general information and do not constitute legal advice. Laws vary by country and region. You are responsible for ensuring that these Terms are appropriate for your specific legal obligations and for seeking advice from a qualified lawyer where needed.

1. Use of the App

1.1 Eligibility  
You may use the App only if you are legally capable of entering into a binding agreement in your jurisdiction and are not barred from using the App under any applicable law.

1.2 Personal, Non-Commercial Use  
The App is provided for your personal, non-commercial use. You agree not to use the App for any illegal, unauthorized, or prohibited purpose.

1.3 Account Responsibility  
If you create an account, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials and for all activities that occur under your account. You agree to notify us promptly of any unauthorized use of your account.

2. User Content

2.1 Your Data  
You may provide information such as trip details, packing lists, notes, and preferences (“User Content”). You retain ownership of your User Content, but you grant us a limited, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, store, process, and display User Content as necessary to operate and improve the App.

2.2 Prohibited Content  
You agree not to submit any User Content that is unlawful, harmful, abusive, harassing, defamatory, obscene, or otherwise objectionable, or that infringes any third party’s rights.

3. AI and Recommendations

The App may use automated systems or third-party AI services to generate packing suggestions, tips, or other recommendations. These outputs are provided for informational and convenience purposes only and should not be considered professional, medical, legal, or travel advice.

You remain solely responsible for decisions you make based on any suggestions or outputs from the App, including what you pack, where you travel, and how you manage your health, safety, and belongings.

4. Third-Party Services

The App may integrate with or link to third-party services (such as authentication providers, cloud platforms, or AI services). Your use of any third-party service is subject to that third party’s own terms and privacy policies. We are not responsible for the content, policies, or practices of third-party services.

5. Privacy

Your use of the App is also governed by our Privacy Policy, which explains how we collect, use, and protect your information. By using the App, you consent to the collection and use of your information as described in the Privacy Policy.

6. Intellectual Property

The App, including its design, text, graphics, logos, and software, is owned by us or our licensors and is protected by intellectual property laws. You are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the App solely in accordance with these Terms.

You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, lease, reverse engineer, or otherwise attempt to extract the source code of the App except as permitted by law.

7. Disclaimers

The App is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis, without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties, including any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

We do not warrant that the App will be uninterrupted, secure, or error-free, or that any defects will be corrected. We are not responsible for any loss of data or harm resulting from your use of the App.

8. Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law, we will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or for any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or for any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from:
- your access to or use of, or inability to access or use, the App;
- any conduct or content of any third party; or
- unauthorized access, use, or alteration of your transmissions or content.

Where liability cannot be excluded entirely under applicable law, our total aggregate liability arising out of or relating to your use of the App will be limited to the amount you have paid (if any) for use of the App in the twelve (12) months prior to the event giving rise to the claim, or the minimum amount permitted by law if greater.

9. Indemnification

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless us, our affiliates, and our respective officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising out of or in any way connected with your use of the App, your violation of these Terms, or your infringement of any third-party right.

10. Termination

We may suspend or terminate your access to the App at any time, with or without notice, if we reasonably believe that you have violated these Terms, pose a risk to other users or to us, or if we cease providing the App. You may stop using the App at any time.

Upon termination, your right to use the App will stop immediately. Some provisions of these Terms, such as those relating to intellectual property, disclaimers, limitations of liability, and indemnification, will survive termination.

11. Changes to These Terms

We may update these Terms from time to time. When we do, we will revise the “Last updated” date at the top. In some cases, we may provide additional notice (such as in-app notifications). Your continued use of the App after the updated Terms become effective constitutes your acceptance of the changes.

12. Governing Law

The laws that apply to these Terms and any disputes arising out of or relating to them will depend on your location and our place of establishment. You should update this section with the specific governing law and jurisdiction after consulting with a legal professional.
